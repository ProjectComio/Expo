# Invite
Inviting the bot is pretty straight forward, head over to the [invite](https://comio.cf/invite#8) page click on the invite button.

:::info Note
You need the `MANAGE SERVER` permission on the server you want to add Comio to.

:::tip
You can grant the permissions accordingly, but we strongly recommend that you give Comio the **Administrator** permission so that you don't have to scratch your head messing up the with permissions later.
:::

Authorize the application and there you have it, you've successfully invited **Comio** to your server! ðŸŽ‰
