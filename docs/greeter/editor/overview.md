# Overview
Comio features a very unique image editor, which allows you to design your very own greeting image.

The editor allows you to drag, resize, scale, rotate and flip the elements. You can change the coordinates of the avatar, primary text and secondary text by using the mouse (on PC) or the screen (on phone) to drag them. The position of the background is fixed and can only be changed by modifying the background externally.

:::caution
Devices having screen narrower than **700** pixels will see a cropped portion of the editor. You have to drag to the right of the page to reveal the other portion of the editor.
:::

Below the editor box, you'll find a control panel to modify how your elements look on the image, and a tab (shown  below) to switch between different element editors.
