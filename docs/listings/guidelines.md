# Guidelines

Your server must strictly abide by these additional guidelines, in accordance with the [community guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Failure to do so will result in an un-revocable blacklist from using our services, either on the server basis or on the user basis.

## Server guidelines
- Your listing's custom banner or server icon/banner should not contain any explicit or adult content, as the banner is public on the web.
- Your listing description must not contain or promote child-pornography, self-harm, suspicius links or any malware/token grabbing sites.
- Your listing must not promote, encourage or engage in any illegal behavior.

## User guidelines
- You should not use any scripts, macros or self-bots to bump any server, this will result in a permanent blacklist from our services.
- Servers have a bump cooldown of `2 hours` and users have a bump cooldown of `1 hour`, in other words, a server can only be bumped every 2 hours and a user can only bump a server once a hour (global).

:::info Note
When a visitor tries to join your server via your listing's page, they'll have to solve a Captcha (powered by [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/)) in order to proceed. This feature was implemented to protect servers from unexpected raid or mass-joins..
